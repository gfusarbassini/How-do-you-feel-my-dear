Text Mining and Sentiment Analysis Project On Movie Dialogues

The aim of this paper is to exploit NLP tools and emotion detection in order to analyze the structure of movie scripts. We argue that dialogues reflect the emotion the characters, hence their changes through time. We can therefore proceed in understand how those are related to particular narrative styles. We develope a model with Support Vector Machine on a dataset classified on a slightly modified Ekmanâ€™s six basic emotions. Then, we apply the model on scraped scripts. The analysis is enriched by the case study of "Annie Hall" (1977) by Woody Allen, a love story with no happy ending, testified by the emotional behaviour of its protagonist.
